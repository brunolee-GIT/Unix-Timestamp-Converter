>> **What is Unix Time?**
>>
> *"Unix Time is a date and time representation widely used in computing.* <br>
> *It measures time by the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, the Unix epoch, without adjustments made due to leap seconds.* <br>
> *The Unix time 0 is exactly midnight UTC on 1 January 1970, with Unix time incrementing by 1 for every non-leap second after this.* <br>
> *For example, 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1971 is represented in Unix time as 31536000."*
